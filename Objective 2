Objective 2: Log File Analyzer
Python script:

import re
from collections import Counter

log_file = "/path/to/logfile.log"

# Analyze log file
with open(log_file, "r") as file:
    logs = file.readlines()

# 404 errors
errors_404 = [line for line in logs if "404" in line]
print(f"Number of 404 errors: {len(errors_404)}")

# Most requested pages
pages = [re.search(r'"GET (.*?) HTTP', line).group(1) for line in logs if "GET" in line]
most_requested = Counter(pages).most_common(5)
print("Most requested pages:")
for page, count in most_requested:
    print(f"{page}: {count} requests")

# IPs with most requests
ips = [line.split()[0] for line in logs]
most_active_ips = Counter(ips).most_common(5)
print("Most active IPs:")
for ip, count in most_active_ips:
    print(f"{ip}: {count} requests")
